# Overview
The "Creator" serves as an external yet integral component of the project, playing a crucial role in its overall effectiveness. Its primary function is to facilitate the creation of mods for the client, enabling the implementation of various tasks. This proves advantageous in augmenting client functionality tailored to specific users' needs, without imposing features upon them. The Creator contributes to maintaining the project's lightweight nature, which aligns with its primary objective. Developers leverage the Creator, functioning as a sort of API, to generate and employ client resources seamlessly. This empowers them to enhance the client's capabilities and integrate new features efficiently.

# Basic
Use the mod.hpp file as an interface and link to required libs in client folder
